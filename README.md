# PHP-OOP-MVC
An Implementation Of MVC Pattern On PHP

Download / clone this repo then go to `app/config` where this app is configured (db, baseurl, .etc)

for example, import the sql file in the root folder (this repo). Dont forget to create a db called `phpmvc` before.
after that, rename this repo to `phpmvc` and move to htdocs folder (if you're using bundle such xampp or else).
finally open up your browser, type `localost/phpmvc/public`. this is your root url.

then explore your creativity :)
